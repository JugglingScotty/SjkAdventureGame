# SjkAdventureGame
A short coding activity with modules for Room, Player, and Map.  In the game, you can walk in the cardinal directions (North, South, West, East), 
display the number of steps, show the map, and exit the game.  

The game is created in Python.  

The repository also contains a file contents.csv which is used as the contents for the room and is imported upon game start.  And a file (incomplete) used 
to run unit tests on the main program.
