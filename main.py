This is a basic version of the Adventure game. It is completely text-based.
In this version of the game, users can move about through different rooms within a single setting,
and based on the user input, it will provide descriptions for each room. This is one of the
interesting python projects.

Movement direction is crucial here â€“ you must create walls and set the directions in which the
users can move through the rooms, set movement restrictions, and also include a tracker that can
track how far a user has walked or moved in the game.

'''

coordinate_x = 0
coordinate_y = 0

# create a room
new_room = Room(coordinate_x, coordinate_y)

# todo Room instances should have values for the walls for N, S, E, W.
# todo The value for a wall should be either a blank wall or a passage.
# todo the room should contain something of note.
# todo The user should provide input for choosing a direction.
# todo upon choosing a direction, the program should create a new room.
# todo new room creation needs to have a passage that connects back to the previous.
# todo an option for the player should be to display the map.
# todo rooms should contain passages that connect to existing room.
