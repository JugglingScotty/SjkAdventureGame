'''

This is a basic version. of the Adventure game. It is completely text-based.
In this version of the game, users can move about through different rooms within a single setting,
and based on the user input, it will provide descriptions for each room. This is one of the
interesting python projects.

Movement direction is crucial here â€“ you must create walls and set the directions in which the
users can move through the rooms, set movement restrictions, and also include a tracker that can
track how far a user has walked or moved in the game
